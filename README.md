# C++ OOP Libraries & Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) libraries** and **practical exercises** designed to strengthen core OOP concepts through clean, reusable, and well-structured code.

The repository focuses on building **utility libraries** (such as Date and String manipulation) while applying the **four fundamental OOP principles** in real, meaningful scenarios.

The libraries and exercises were built as part of the learning path:
**Cplusplus V3 – V4**, emphasizing hands-on OOP design and implementation.

📌 All library implementations and exercises in this repository were covered in **Course 10** of the **Programming Advices** platform.

## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository includes:

- 📚 **Custom C++ Libraries**
  - `clsDate` – Date handling & calendar utilities
  - `clsString` – Advanced string manipulation utilities

- 🧪 **Practice Exercises**
  - Exercises demonstrating the **four core OOP concepts**
  - Console-based testing and usage examples

- 🧠 Strong focus on **clean class design**, constructors, static methods, and object behavior

---

## 🧱 Core OOP Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Encapsulation
- Private data members with controlled access
- Getter / Setter methods
- Object state protection
- Examples:
  - `_Date` in `clsDate`
  - `_Value` in `clsString`

---

### 🔹 Abstraction
- Hiding implementation details behind clear interfaces
- Complex logic simplified into reusable methods
- Utility functions exposed through meaningful class APIs

---

### 🔹 Inheritance
- Prepared class designs suitable for extension
- Reusable base structures for future derived classes
- Foundation for advanced OOP expansion

---

### 🔹 Polymorphism
- Method overloading
- Static vs non-static method behavior
- Same interface, different usage patterns

---

## 📚 Libraries Included

### 🗓️ clsDate Library
A comprehensive date-handling utility class supporting:

- System date initialization
- Multiple constructors:
  - Default (system date)
  - String-based date
  - Day / Month / Year
  - Day-order-in-year
- Leap year checking
- Date calculations
- Month calendar printing
- Day & month name utilities

📌 Designed to demonstrate **state-based behavior** and **object responsibility**.

---

### 🔤 clsString Library
A powerful string manipulation utility class featuring:

- Word & letter counting
- Case conversion (upper / lower / invert)
- Trimming (left / right / full)
- String splitting & joining
- Replace words (case-sensitive & insensitive)
- Reverse words
- Remove punctuations
- Static and non-static method usage

📌 Emphasizes **utility-style design**, **reusability**, and **clean APIs**.
